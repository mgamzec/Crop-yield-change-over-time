# Objective
- In this notebook, I visualize the trends of crop yields in most populated countries over time. 
- I also visualize the population growth in the world and the populated countries. 
  - I worked on few countries in this notebook to optimally utilize the space. However, readers can use this code for the countries and crops of their choice.  
- Also,modelling and visualize the change in crop yield over time in the selected countries.
